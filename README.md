## What is Google Analytics?

`Fragment - What is Google Analytics?`

Google Analytics is a free Google product your web developer can install that collects visitor data from your website. This data is used to create reports that provide insight into how visitors are using your website.
Your website serves as a hub for all of your digital traffic. If you are running any marketing activities such as search ads or social media ads, your users are most likely going to visit your website somewhere along their user journey.
Given that your website is the central hub of your digital presence, your website is the best way to give you a holistic view of the effectiveness of all the campaigns you are running to promote your product/services online. Google Analytics is a free tool that can help you track your digital marketing effectiveness.
That’s why over 50 million websites around the world uses Google Analytics.

## History

`Fragment - "In April 2005"`

Google acquired Urchin Software Corp. in April 2005. Google's service was developed from Urchin on Demand. The system also brings ideas from Adaptive Path, whose product, Measure Map, was acquired and used in the redesign of Google Analytics in 2006. Before August 2006, Google was sending out batches of invitation codes as server availability permitted;

`Slide - "Google Analytics features"`

## Google Analytics features include:

`Fragment - "Data visualization tools"`

`Fragment - "Segmentation for analysis of subsets"`

• Segmentation for analysis of subsets, such as conversions.

`Fragment - "Custom reports"`

`Fragment - "Email-based sharing and communication"`

`Fragment - "Integration with other Google products"`

• Integration with other Google products, such as AdWords, Public Data Explorer and Website Optimizer.

Google analytics is used to track the website activity of the users such as session duration, pages per session, bounce rate etc. along with the information on the source of the traffic. It can be integrated with Google AdWords, with which users can review online campaigns by tracking landing page quality and conversions (goals). Goals might include sales, lead generation, viewing a specific page, or downloading a particular file.

`Slide - "How does Google Analytics Work?"`

## How does Google Analytics Work?

Google Analytics is implemented with "page tags", in this case, called the Google Analytics Tracking Code, which is a snippet of JavaScript code that the website owner adds to every page of the website. The tracking code runs in the client browser when the client browses the page (if JavaScript is enabled in the browser) and collects visitor data and sends it to a Google data collection server as part of a request for a web beacon.

`Slide - "LEVELS OF DATA COLLECTED FROM YOUR WEBSITE"`

Next, Google Analytics aggregates the data collected from your website in multiple ways, primarily by four levels:

`Fragment - "User level"`

1.	User level (related to actions by each user)

`Fragment - "Session level"`

2.	Session level (each individual visit)

`Fragment - "Pageview level"`

3.	Pageview level (each individual page visited)

`Fragment - "Event level"`

4.	Event level (button clicks, video views, etc)


All the data you see in Google Analytics, all variables in reports is either a dimension or a metric. Google explains dimensions as:

`Slide - "What are dimensions in Google Analytics?"`

## What are dimensions in Google Analytics?

Dimensions are attributes of your data.

`Slide - "Picture of dimension"`

So in a way, a dimension is a description, a characteristic, a feature or aspect of your data. It’s not a quantitative variable but more a qualitative variable. 

`Slide - "Examples of dimension"`

Examples of dimension:

`Fragment - "Examples"`

•	City

•	Device

•	Source/Medium

•	Campaign

•	Page

•	Goals

•	Products

`Slide - "What are metrics in Google Analytics?"`

## What are metrics in Google Analytics?

Metrics are the numbers you see in each dimension. Metrics show you what a user did on your site, expressed in numbers. For example, if we look at the Behavior – All Pages report:

Metrics need dimensions, for context, otherwise, it’s just numbers.

`Slide - "Picture of metrics"`

## What are the distinctions between Metrics and Dimensions on Google Analytics?

The way I think about the differences between metrics and dimensions is that metrics are actual statistics Google collected about user behavior on your website, and dimensions are the various ways you can view those numbers based on the business questions you’re trying to answer.
For example, just knowing the total amount of people visiting your website is not very helpful to your business. Knowing how many people visit your website by age or location, on the other hand, is very helpful to figure out who your core audiences are on the internet.

## What kind of data are available on Google Analytics, and what can you do with them?

`Fragment - "Types of data"`

There are two types of data that you can collect in Google Analytics:

`Fragment - "User Acquisition Data"`

1.	User Acquisition Data: data about your users before they visit your website

`Fragment - "User Behavior Data"`

2.	User Behavior Data: data about your users when they visit your website

(1) User Acquisition Data

Before users visit your website: you can access data about your user demographics before they visit your website (e.g. their age, gender, and interests). You can also get data about where they are coming from, whether that’s Facebook, other websites, or Google search. I call these data “user acquisition data” because they can help you figure out which user group and channels to target.

(2) User Behavior Data

The second group of data are “user behavior” data, which are collected during a user’s session on your website. “User behavior” data include:

•	how long a user stayed on your website

•	what is their first and last page on your website

•	the most common “pathway” through which they go through your website
